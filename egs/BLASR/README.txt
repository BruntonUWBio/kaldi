This is a folder created for the Brunton Lab Automated Speech Recognition project.

It is based on the Kaldi example recipes provided for the Switchboard Dataset. 

The aim is to be able to automatically create transcripts of our patient audio files. We will use the Switchboard data to boost our annotated data.
